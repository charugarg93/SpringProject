In this lab we will practice configuring your beans and accessing them using ApplicationContext.
The objective of this lab is to get accustomed to the syntax and not worry about integrating any framework with it.

You want to schedule the sessions for a Conference.
The Conference uses a SessionPlanner for the same.
The SessionPlanner loads the topics from a properties file.

The topics are given below.
Functional programming with Groovy - 60 min
Scala Tricks - 45 min
Spring unit testing - 50 min
Unit testing JavaScript - 50 min
Concurrency on the JVM - 60 min
Grails for MVC- 45 min
Server side JavaScript - 50 min

The SessionPlanner splits the data to 60 min topics, 45 min topics and 50 min topics.
Design the Conference and SessionPlanner classes and configure the beans.
Create a User class that will create an instance of the Conference object
and print the total number of 60 min/50 min/45 min topics.

Hint:

1) You can create a sessions.properties file like this.

topic1=Functional programming with Groovy - 60 min
topic2=Spring unit testing - 50 min
topic3=Unit testing JavaScript - 50 min
topic4=Concurrency on the JVM - 60 min
topic7=Grails for MVC- 45 min
topic5=Server side JavaScript - 50 min
topic6=Scala Tricks - 45 min

2) Use util:properties to load the properties file and wire it with your bean
